Org-transclusion lets you insert a copy of text content via a file link or ID link within an Org file. It lets you have the same content present in different buffers at the same time without copy-and-pasting it. Edit the source of the content, and you can refresh the transcluded copies to the up-to-date state. Org-transclusion keeps your files clear of the transcluded copies, leaving only the links to the original content.<<whatis>>

A complete user manual is available [[https://nobiot.github.io/org-transclusion/][online]] or Emacs in-system as an Info document (=C-h i= and find the =Org-transclusion= node).

For installation, refer to [[*Installation][Instalaltion]] below or the corresponding section in the user manaul.

The [[https://nobiot.github.io/org-transclusion/#Getting-Started][Getting Started]] in the user manaul will get you started in 5 minutes.

* Example Use Cases & Main Features
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: use-cases
:END:

Here are a summary of some real use cases that users have shared with the author, including his own.

- Book writing ::
  
  You have a collection of notes. You can quickly transclude paragraphs and sections from your notes and put together a draft. As transclusions are links, it's easy to re-organize them into different sequences to see which way works the best. 

- Academic writing ::
  
  You have a collection of quotes and notes from your research and literature review. Transclude relevant elements of quotes and notes into different papers. You can keep your collection as the central repository of your research.

- Technical writing ::

  You write technical documents for software. Transclude relevant lines of code into the document. As the code is only transcluded, you can keep the document up-to-date as the code evolves.

- Project status reports ::

  You work on multiple projects at the same time and need to report to different project managers. Transclude relevant parts of your work notes and logs into respective project reports. You can keep a single collection of your work notes and logs.

Main Features:

- Insert a copy of text content via a file link or ID link into an Org file

- Work with any text file such as program source cod, plain text, Markdown, or other Org files

- Keep the file system clear of the copies of text content -- Org-transclusion tries hard to save only the links to the file system

- For Org files, use different headline levels from the source Org file

- For Org files, use filters to include only relevant elements (e.g. filter out properties in the transclusions)

- For program source and plain text files, transclude a certain lines or dynamically specify the from/to lines to keep the transclusion always up-to-date with the evolving source files

- For program source files, transclude parts or whole code directly into Org's source block to leverage the rich Org features

- Extend Org-transclusion with its extension framework

;; ~/.doom.d/config.el
(use-package! org-transclusion
  :after org
  :init
  (map!
   :map global-map "<f12>" #'org-transclusion-add
   :leader
   :prefix "n"
   :desc "Org Transclusion Mode" "t" #'org-transclusion-mode))
#+END_SRC
